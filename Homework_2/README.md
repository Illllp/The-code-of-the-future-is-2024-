## Python Dictionary and List Operations

This program demonstrates basic operations with dictionaries and lists in Python.

### Features

* **Dictionary Creation and Modification:**
    - Creates a dictionary `car` with keys 'Make', 'model', and 'year'.
    - Adds a new key-value pair 'color' with the value 'black'.
    - Prints the value associated with the key 'Make' and the entire dictionary.

* **List Operations:**
    - Creates a list `fruits` containing names of fruits.
    - Prints the first element of the list (index 0).

* **Tuple Example:**
    - Creates a tuple `numbers` containing a sequence of numbers.
    - Prints the last element of the tuple (using negative indexing).

### How to run

1. Save the code as `main.py`.
2. Run the script from your terminal using the command `python main.py`.

### Output

The program will print the following output:

```
WW
{'Make': 'WW', 'model': 'WY', 'year': '1992', 'color': 'black'}
apple
666
```

### Notes

* **Dictionaries:**
    - Dictionaries are used to store key-value pairs.
    - Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers).
    - Values can be any Python data type.
* **Lists:**
    - Lists are ordered collections of elements.
    - Elements can be accessed by their index (starting from 0).
* **Tuples:**
    - Tuples are similar to lists but immutable (cannot be modified after creation).
    - They are often used to represent fixed sets of data.
