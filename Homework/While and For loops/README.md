## Summary of the Two Python Codes

**Beginner Level: Task 1 - Code using a for loop**

This code prompts the user to enter an integer `n` and then uses a `for` loop to print the numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive). The `range(n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`, and the `for` loop iterates over this sequence, assigning each number to the variable `i`. The `print(i)` statement then prints the current value of `i` to the screen.

**Intermediate Level: Task 1 - Code using a while loop**

This code also prompts the user to enter an integer `n` and then uses a `while` loop to print the numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive). The variable `i` is initialized to 0, and the `while` loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. The `print(i)` statement prints the current value of `i` to the screen, and the `i += 1` statement increments the value of `i` by 1. When `i` becomes greater than `n`, the `while` loop terminates, and the program ends.

**Key Differences:**

* **Loop Type:** The beginner-level code uses a `for` loop, while the intermediate-level code uses a `while` loop.
* **Loop Iteration:** The `for` loop iterates over a known sequence of numbers, while the `while` loop continues to execute until a specific condition is met.

**Overall, both codes achieve the same goal of printing the numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive), but they use different looping mechanisms.**
