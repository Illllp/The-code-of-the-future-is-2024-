# Greetings, and Welcome to My GitHub Repository!

Hello there, esteemed teacher! My name is Rodion Mikhailovich Shilovsky, and I am a dedicated student in the realm of programming, eager to learn and grow in the ever-evolving field of technology. I am delighted to share my journey and projects with you as I delve deeper into the fascinating world of programming. This repository serves as a testament to my early steps in learning Python, which commenced with the exceptional "Code of the Future" program. Let's explore the highlights of this repository together:

## Introduction to Programming (Python)
As part of the "Code of the Future" curriculum, we began our journey by exploring one of the most popular languages today - Python. In this section, I would like to present my first simple script that demonstrates how to record and print a full user name using proper formatting techniques.

### A Simple Greeting Message Script
Here's an example of how to store your full name and then use it within a friendly welcome message:
```python
# Recording the full user name
my_full_name = "Shilovsky Rodion Mikhailovich"

# Printing a greeting message with the user's full name
print(f'Hello, {my_full_name}, nice to meet you.')
```
This script simply stores the full user name as a string variable `my_full_name`. Then, it utilizes f-string interpolation to insert the value of `my_full_name` inside the welcome message printed on the console screen.

*For any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.*
